## 🦀 hello-world.rs 🦀

🦀 Memory safe, blazing fast, minimal and configurable hello world project written in the rust(🦀) programming language 🦀

🦀 While this depends on more c code than rust(🦀) code to compile, because rust(🦀) is magically **memory safe**, now all c code is memory safe too 🦀

🦀 This project is very minimal, it only requires **1092** crates 🦀

### Building

To compile this project you need only one library 🦀:

<div>1. <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/download/">cairo development libraries</a> 🦀.</div>
<div>1. <a href="https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/">libgtk development libraries</a> 🦀.</div>
<div>1. alsa-lib 🦀</div>
<div>1. glfw 🦀</div>
<div>1. freetype 🦀</div>
<div>1. libglib 🦀</div>
<div>1. pango 🦀</div>
<div>1. atk 🦀</div>
<div>1. pixbuf 🦀</div>
<div>1. gdk 🦀</div>
</br>
<div>Just 1 lib as you can see the number list along the names 🦀</div>
</br>

You probably have most of them already, if it says something along the words, you know what to search for now

Then you can just `make` and the compiled executable should be located in `./target/release/hello-world` run it or install it with `make install`
.

Due to the lightweightness of rust(🦀), unlike node_modules being fairly large for few dependencies, rust(🦀) manages compile caches efficiently and stores them to storage to save compile times! Just **33G** target folder, the compile time is only around **2 hours and 30 minutes** on my mac on release mode

A clean build makes it take around _3.8G_

The CPU usage is pretty minimal too (release mode)

It is slower than echo but memory safety comes at a cost! We need to be memory chad and blazing pure and lightning based

### Why rust(🦀) while its only 1 line and depends on 600 c bind crates?

Here are my takes on that matter

> C in "c language" stands for cringe and CVE 🦀

> R in "rust(🦀) systems programming language" stands for rewrite and robust 🦀

Here are the comments from few of my fellow Rustaceans 🦀

> People ask the question "what's rust(🦀) good for?" pretty frequently, and little terminal apps like this are precisely the reason. [...]. It enables a kind of workflow that simply didn't exist before: I could have a fully safe, "correct", LLVM-optimized binary installed on my desktop in an afternoon.🦀

> Modern rust(🦀) appears pretty similar to modern JavaScript. You declare your variables with let🦀

> I think it would make rust(🦀) more productive if rust(🦀) could absorb Python's ecosystem(many mature wheels) as soon as possible.🦀

> One thing I like about rust(🦀) is that it filters out lazy/sloppy thinkers. Even when I disagree with another rust(🦀) programmer, there is a certain level of respect that comes from knowing that they thought about the problem deeply enough to pass the borrow checker.🦀

> The thing I hate about rust(🦀) the most is that all the other languages feel extra dumb and annoying once I learned borrowing, lifetimes etc.🦀

> "I feel like the discovery of rust(🦀) is transporting me back to my younger self [...]" "When I started learning rust(🦀) in earnest in 2018, I thought this was a fluke. It is just the butterflies you get when you think you fall in love, I told myself."🦀

> rust(🦀)’s product is not a programming language or a compiler. rust(🦀)’s product is the experience of being a rust(🦀) developer🦀

> rust(🦀) can handle CPU-intensive operations such as executing algorithms. 🦀

> Because it’s typically typed, rust(🦀) catches errors at compile time. [...] Also, it compiles code down to machine learning, allowing for extra efficiency.🦀

> Many people try to compare rust(🦀) to Go, but this is flawed. Go is an ancient board game that emphasizes strategy. rust(🦀) is more appropriately compared to Chess, a board game focused on low-level tactics.🦀

> rust(🦀)'s unsafe keyword is a critical innovation for information security. I believe that Safe rust(🦀) will eventually be a foundational technology for all of human society.🦀

> I wish I had a compiler (one as informative as rust(🦀)'s would be amazing) but for Japanese. If I could learn Japanese the way I learn programming I'd be conversationally fluent by now.🦀

> rust(🦀) held onto it’s spot as the most beloved language among the professional developers we surveyed. That said, the majority of developers who took the survey aren’t familiar with the language.🦀

> I've experienced modern package management through Cargo and anything below that level now seems like returning to stone age.🦀

> I probably can write same code in c, but since rust(🦀) is rust(🦀), I need to (re)write in rust(🦀) 🦀

> Wait its only time until rust(🦀) makes assembly memroy safe.🦀

> Done lots of C/C++/Python is the past, just started learning node/JS recently. Just kicked off a rust(🦀) tutorial, you people obviously already know this, but rust(🦀) is basically all the awesomeness of C++ smashed together with all the awesomeness and dependency management of JS. Looking forward to learning more rust(🦀) in the future! 🦀

> All C/C++ devs are absolute fools, they are wasting their time writing c/c++ when instead they could write in rust(🦀)!!!!

> As a rust(🦀) developer, I have no idea how any of this or computers actually works, but its cool to ask people in discord.gg/rust(🦀) for all help and write code🦀
