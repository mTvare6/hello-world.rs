ğŸš€ hello-world.rs ğŸš€
--------------



ğŸš€ Memory safe, blazing fast, minimal and configurable hello world project written in the rust(ğŸš€) programming language  ğŸš€

ğŸš€ While this depends on more c code than rust(ğŸš€) code to compile, because rust(ğŸš€) is magically memory safe, now all c code is memory safe too ğŸš€

ğŸš€ This project is very minimal, it only requires 1039 crates ğŸš€

### Installation
To compile this project you need only one library ğŸš€:

<div>1. The <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/download/">cairo development libraries</a> for cairo-sys ğŸš€.</div>
<div>1. The <a href="https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/">libgtk development libraries</a> for pango-sys ğŸš€.</div>
<div>1. Microsoft/<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg">VCPKG</a> for few other c++ libs ğŸš€.</div>
</br>
<div>Just 1 lib as you can see the number list along the names ğŸš€</div>
</br>

Then you can just `cargo build --release` and the compiled executable should be located in `./target/release/hello-world`.

Due to the lightweightness of rust, unlike node_modules being fairly large for few dependencies, rust manages compile caches efficiently and stores them to storage to save compile times! Just 33G target folder, the compile time is around 2 hours and 30 minutes on my mac on release mode

A clean build makes it take around 3.8G

### Docker

```sh
$ docker build -t hello-world .
$ docker run -it --rm --name hwrs hello-world
```

### Why rust(ğŸš€) while its only 1 line and depends on 600 c bind crates?

Here are the comments from few of my fellow Rustaceans  ğŸš€

> People ask the question "what's rust(ğŸš€) good for?" pretty frequently, and little terminal apps like this are precisely the reason. [...]. It enables a kind of workflow that simply didn't exist before: I could have a fully safe, "correct", LLVM-optimized binary installed on my desktop in an afternoon.ğŸš€

> Modern rust(ğŸš€) appears pretty similar to modern JavaScript. You declare your variables with letğŸš€

> I think it would make rust(ğŸš€) more productive if rust(ğŸš€) could absorb Python's ecosystem(many mature wheels) as soon as possible.ğŸš€

> One thing I like about rust(ğŸš€) is that it filters out lazy/sloppy thinkers. Even when I disagree with another rust(ğŸš€) programmer, there is a certain level of respect that comes from knowing that they thought about the problem deeply enough to pass the borrow checker.ğŸš€

> The thing I hate about rust(ğŸš€) the most is that all the other languages feel extra dumb and annoying once I learned borrowing, lifetimes etc.ğŸš€

> "I feel like the discovery of rust(ğŸš€) is transporting me back to my younger self [...]" "When I started learning rust(ğŸš€) in earnest in 2018, I thought this was a fluke. It is just the butterflies you get when you think you fall in love, I told myself."ğŸš€

> rust(ğŸš€)â€™s product is not a programming language or a compiler. rust(ğŸš€)â€™s product is the experience of being a rust(ğŸš€) developerğŸš€

> rust(ğŸš€) can handle CPU-intensive operations such as executing algorithms. ğŸš€

> Because itâ€™s typically typed, rust(ğŸš€) catches errors at compile time. [...] Also, it compiles code down to machine learning, allowing for extra efficiency.ğŸš€

> Many people try to compare rust(ğŸš€) to Go, but this is flawed. Go is an ancient board game that emphasizes strategy. rust(ğŸš€) is more appropriately compared to Chess, a board game focused on low-level tactics.ğŸš€

> rust(ğŸš€)'s unsafe keyword is a critical innovation for information security. I believe that Safe rust(ğŸš€) will eventually be a foundational technology for all of human society.ğŸš€

> I am too dumb to write c code, even if I spend more time on rust(ğŸš€) writing bad code its rust(ğŸš€), so its betterğŸš€

> Without really understanding anything about rust(ğŸš€), its cool to hangout in discord.gg/rust(ğŸš€) and believe that anything they tell is the right opinionğŸš€

> I wish I had a compiler (one as informative as rust(ğŸš€)'s would be amazing) but for Japanese. If I could learn Japanese the way I learn programming I'd be conversationally fluent by now.ğŸš€

> rust(ğŸš€) held onto itâ€™s spot as the most beloved language among the professional developers we surveyed. That said, the majority of developers who took the survey arenâ€™t familiar with the language.ğŸš€

> I've experienced modern package management through Cargo and anything below that level now seems like returning to stone age.ğŸš€

> C in "c programming language" stands for cringe ğŸš€

> Wait its only time until rust(ğŸš€) makes assembly memroy safe.ğŸš€

> Done lots of C/C++/Python is the past, just started learning node/JS recently. Just kicked off a rust(ğŸš€) tutorial, you people obviously already know this, but rust(ğŸš€) is basically all the awesomeness of C++ smashed together with all the awesomeness and dependency management of JS. Looking forward to learning more rust(ğŸš€) in the future! ğŸš€

> All C/C++ devs are absolute fools, they are wasting their time writing c/c++ when instead they could write in rust(ğŸš€)!!!!

> As a rust(ğŸš€) developer, I have no idea how any of this or computers actually works, but its cool to ask people in discord.gg/rust(ğŸš€) for all help and write codeğŸš€
