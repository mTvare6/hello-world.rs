# ğŸš€ hello-world.rs ğŸš€

ğŸš€ Memory safe, blazing fast, minimal and configurable hello world project written in the rust(ğŸš€) programming language ğŸš€

ğŸš€ While this depends on more c code than rust(ğŸš€) code to compile, because rust(ğŸš€) is magically **memory safe**, now all c code is memory safe too ğŸš€

ğŸš€ This project is very minimal, it only requires **1092** crates ğŸš€

### Building

To compile this project you need only one library ğŸš€:

<div>1. <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/download/">cairo development libraries</a> ğŸš€.</div>
<div>1. <a href="https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/">libgtk development libraries</a> ğŸš€.</div>
<div>1. alsa-lib ğŸš€</div>
<div>1. glfw ğŸš€</div>
<div>1. freetype ğŸš€</div>
<div>1. libglib ğŸš€</div>
<div>1. pango ğŸš€</div>
<div>1. atk ğŸš€</div>
<div>1. pixbuf ğŸš€</div>
<div>1. gdk ğŸš€</div>
</br>
<div>Just 1 lib as you can see the number list along the names ğŸš€</div>
</br>

You probably have most of them already, if it says something along the words, you know what to search for now

Then you can just `make` and the compiled executable should be located in `./target/release/hello-world` run it or install it with `make install`
.

Due to the lightweightness of rust(ğŸš€), unlike node_modules being fairly large for few dependencies, rust(ğŸš€) manages compile caches efficiently and stores them to storage to save compile times! Just **33G** target folder, the compile time is only around **2 hours and 30 minutes** on my mac on release mode

A clean build makes it take around _3.8G_

The CPU usage is pretty minimal too (release mode)

It is slower than echo but memory safety comes at a cost! We need to be memory chad and blazing pure and lightning based

### Why rust(ğŸš€) while its only 1 line and depends on 600 c bind crates?

Here are my takes on that matter

> **C** in "c language" stands for **C**ringe and **C**VE and **C**ervical **C**apricious **C**atastrophic **C**hthonic **C**lumsy **C**lueless **C**omplex and **C**ryptic ğŸ¤®

> **R** in "rust(ğŸš€) systems programming language" stands for **R**ewrite, **R**obust, **R**eliable, **R**ambunctious, **R**eprehensibl[ly great] and **S**ecureğŸš€

> [Since hello-world.rs is written in blazingly pure, configurable, lightweight and memory pure rust(ğŸš€) - the CVEs are secure, memory chad and blazing pure](https://github.com/mTvare6/hello-world.rs/issues/) ğŸš€


Here are the comments from few of my fellow Rustaceans ğŸš€

> People ask the question "what's rust(ğŸš€) good for?" pretty frequently, and little terminal apps like this are precisely the reason. [...]. It enables a kind of workflow that simply didn't exist before: I could have a fully safe, "correct", LLVM-optimized binary installed on my desktop in an afternoon.ğŸš€

> Modern rust(ğŸš€) appears pretty similar to modern JavaScript. You declare your variables with letğŸš€

> I think it would make rust(ğŸš€) more productive if rust(ğŸš€) could absorb Python's ecosystem(many mature wheels) as soon as possible.ğŸš€

> One thing I like about rust(ğŸš€) is that it filters out lazy/sloppy thinkers. Even when I disagree with another rust(ğŸš€) programmer, there is a certain level of respect that comes from knowing that they thought about the problem deeply enough to pass the borrow checker.ğŸš€

> The thing I hate about rust(ğŸš€) the most is that all the other languages feel extra dumb and annoying once I learned borrowing, lifetimes etc.ğŸš€

> "I feel like the discovery of rust(ğŸš€) is transporting me back to my younger self [...]" "When I started learning rust(ğŸš€) in earnest in 2018, I thought this was a fluke. It is just the butterflies you get when you think you fall in love, I told myself."ğŸš€

> rust(ğŸš€)â€™s product is not a programming language or a compiler. rust(ğŸš€)â€™s product is the experience of being a rust(ğŸš€) developerğŸš€

> rust(ğŸš€) can handle CPU-intensive operations such as executing algorithms. ğŸš€

> Because itâ€™s typically typed, rust(ğŸš€) catches errors at compile time. [...] Also, it compiles code down to machine learning, allowing for extra efficiency.ğŸš€

> Many people try to compare rust(ğŸš€) to Go, but this is flawed. Go is an ancient board game that emphasizes strategy. rust(ğŸš€) is more appropriately compared to Chess, a board game focused on low-level tactics.ğŸš€

> rust(ğŸš€)'s unsafe keyword is a critical innovation for information security. I believe that Safe rust(ğŸš€) will eventually be a foundational technology for all of human society.ğŸš€

> I wish I had a compiler (one as informative as rust(ğŸš€)'s would be amazing) but for Japanese. If I could learn Japanese the way I learn programming I'd be conversationally fluent by now.ğŸš€

> rust(ğŸš€) held onto itâ€™s spot as the most beloved language among the professional developers we surveyed. That said, the majority of developers who took the survey arenâ€™t familiar with the language.ğŸš€

> I've experienced modern package management through Cargo and anything below that level now seems like returning to stone age.ğŸš€

> I probably can write same code in c, but since rust(ğŸš€) is rust(ğŸš€), I need to (re)write in rust(ğŸš€) ğŸš€

> Wait its only time until rust(ğŸš€) makes assembly memory safe.ğŸš€

> Done lots of C/C++/Python is the past, just started learning node/JS recently. Just kicked off a rust(ğŸš€) tutorial, you people obviously already know this, but rust(ğŸš€) is basically all the awesomeness of C++ smashed together with all the awesomeness and dependency management of JS. Looking forward to learning more rust(ğŸš€) in the future! ğŸš€

> All C/C++ devs are absolute fools, they are wasting their time writing c/c++ when instead they could write in rust(ğŸš€)!

> [C devs are people who use leeches to cure diseases](https://matrix.to/#/!CkLhFPTTdUYTfxSNGd:libera.chat/$nlVNx5d4nW6dNd7Y_0M6feEdwln2xU_mIUOivwJaXgM?via=libera.chat&via=matrix.org&via=halogen.city) ğŸš€

> As a rust(ğŸš€) developer, I have no idea how any of my code or computers actually works, but its cool to ask people in discord.gg/rust(ğŸš€) for all help and write codeğŸš€

I've recently added source to where I've got these quotes from, when I get time I will add sources to where there messages are from, for now some sources aren't marked
